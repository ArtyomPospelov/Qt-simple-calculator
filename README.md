## Description
Implementation of a simple desktop calculator on the Qt framework. With a slight claim to style.
The project is being developed in the Qt creator environment. OOP is actively used in the course of work. Resources (of which there are few) are included in the project build (.qrc file). When compiling, an executable file is created, which is not very convenient to use directly, since a configuration file will always be created next to it (config.xml ). Therefore, it is better to put the executable file in a separate folder and create a shortcut to it.
## Mini user manual
After the project is assembled, place the executable file of the application in some "special" folder, create a shortcut to this file. You can freely place the shortcut in a convenient place (on the desktop, for example). After you have worked with the calculator for the first time and closed it, a configuration file is created in a "special" folder (it is always created next to the executable file in the same folder). If you want to reset the settings, just delete this file.
## Project Features
* The project is being developed in the Qt creator IDE on Linux OS;
* C++ 17;
* OOP;
* QSS stylized appearance;
* Resources are included in the build (.qrc) file, no extra folders and sewn paths to resources;
* Storing application settings in a configuration file (some more settings will be added).
## Cross-platform support
The project was tested only for Linux (in particular in the Ubuntu Linux family). I haven't built it for Windows yet. But it should be assembled under this OS and work the same way.
