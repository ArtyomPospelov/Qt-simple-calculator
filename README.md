## Description
Implementation of a simple desktop calculator on the Qt framework. With a slight claim to style.
The project is being developed in the Qt creator environment. OOP is actively used in the course of work. Resources (of which there are few) are included in the project build (.qrc file). At the output, an executable file and a configuration file are created as a ready-made solution (config.xml ) next to this file.
## Mini user manual
After building the project, place its files (executable and configuration) in a folder convenient for you, create a shortcut to the executable file and place it in a convenient place (on the desktop, for example).
